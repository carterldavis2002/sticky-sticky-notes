BIG PICTURE ISSUES:
-Potential for z-index to overflow, could try flipping sign somehow while
preserving note stack order if z-index reaches a certain value

POTENTIAL FEATURES:
-Settings menu (maybe always show all notes on screen?)
-Settings persist (new item to localStorage?)
-Maybe fix note height and just add scroll bar?

UNDO COMMANDS:
-Undo action message
-redo button alongside undo
